# RP2040 Module
## Introduction
A small-footprint RP2040 breakout board, with additional features like extended memory and a fast optically-isolated interface. 
## Project Motivation
Two projects of mine, a [breakout board](https://github.com/NNNILabs/AD4630-Wideband-Digital-LNA) investigating the AD4630 and a [modular power supply](https://github.com/diminDDL/TripleChannelPSU), both needed a compact RP2040 breakout board. Since they needed some shared features, I decided to make one board to use with both (and possibly more) projects.
## Usage
[under construction]
## List of Files
- Hardware: KiCAD PCB files, 3D models

## Application Examples

## Notes
- Projects like the [RP2040 Stamp](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rp2040-stamp?variant=39567567028307) and the [RP2040 ISP Stamp](https://www.osborneee.com/rp2040-isp-stamp/) exist, but they lack some of the features I need and modifying the files was very difficult because of sketchy layout. I decided I could do better in the latter aspect.
